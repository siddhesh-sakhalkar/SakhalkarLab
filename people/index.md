### **<span style="font-size: 1.1em;">Bio</span>**
Dr. Siddhesh Sakhalkar has a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (2010-2014) and a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from University of California, Berkeley (2016-2020). He has 7 years of industry experience, including 5 years as a Mechanical Simulation Engineer at Western Digital in San Jose, USA (2020-2025) and 2 years as a Mechanical Static Engineer at Shell (2014-2016). Dr. Sakhalkar’s doctoral research focused on developing numerical models to study nanoscale lubricant flow, air bearing flow, interfacial forces and heat transfer at the head-disk interface in hard disk drives (HDDs). At Western Digital, he worked on improving the structural dynamics and robustness of HDD actuators to meet nanoscale positioning accuracy targets for the recording head in next-generation technologies. His research interests include developing theoretical frameworks, numerical models and machine learning methodologies to advance the mechanical design of complex engineering systems across multiple length scales, ranging from macro to micro and nano. Dr. Sakhalkar is a recipient of the John and Janet McMurtry Fellowship, The Otto and Herta F. Kornei Endowment Fund Fellowship and the ASME 28th Conference on Information Storage and Processing Systems Best Paper Award. His CV can be found here.
